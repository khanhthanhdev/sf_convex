# Detailed MVP Implementation Plan: AI Video Tutor Platform

This plan outlines the step-by-step implementation of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for the AI Video Tutor Platform. It focuses on defining the necessary functions and tasks for each component, without including specific code examples or a fixed timeline.

## Phase 1: Define Backend Components and Functions

**Goal:** Establish the foundational backend services and ensure the core AI agents can generate video chunks and handle basic editing requests.

### 1.1. Convex.dev Backend Setup

#### Functions to Define:
*   **Schema Definition:** Define the data models for `Projects`, `VideoSessions`, `SceneMetadata`, and `Users`. This includes specifying fields like project ID, video ID, scene ID, S3 URL for video chunks, scene duration, status, and user details.
*   **CRUD Operations for Core Models:** Implement functions to create, read, update, and delete entries for `Projects`, `VideoSessions`, and `Users`.
*   **Scene Metadata Management:** Define functions to list and update `SceneMetadata` entries, particularly for tracking the status and S3 URLs of video chunks.
*   **Authentication:** Set up user authentication mechanisms, such as email/password or integration with an OAuth provider.
*   **Webhook Trigger Function:** Create a Convex function that can be called by the frontend to trigger a FastAPI endpoint via a webhook, initiating video generation or scene editing processes.
*   **Scene Update Function:** Implement a Convex function that can be called by the FastAPI backend to update the status, S3 URLs, and other metadata of a specific scene after it has been processed or re-rendered.

### 1.2. FastAPI Multi-Agent System Refinement

**Goal:** Adapt the existing multi-agent system to work with the new architecture, handle video chunking, and respond to editing requests.

#### Functions to Define:
*   **Video Generation Endpoint:** Create a FastAPI endpoint that receives requests to generate a new video. This endpoint will accept parameters such as `project_id`, `content_prompt`, and `scene_count`.
*   **Scene Editing Endpoint:** Create a FastAPI endpoint that receives requests to edit a specific scene. This endpoint will accept parameters such as `scene_id`, `edit_prompt`, and `project_id`.
*   **Background Task Processing:** Implement asynchronous background tasks for both video generation and scene editing to avoid blocking the main API thread. These tasks will orchestrate the calls to various agents and external services.
*   **Video Generation Orchestration Function:** This function will:
    *   Call the existing core video generation function.
    *   Process the output to break it down into individual video chunks.
    *   Upload each video chunk to AWS S3.
    *   Upload the corresponding Manim source code for each scene to AWS S3.
    *   Update Convex.dev with the S3 URLs and status for each generated scene.
*   **Scene Editing Orchestration Function:** This function will:
    *   Retrieve the original Manim source code for the specified `scene_id` from AWS S3.
    *   Call the `Code Generation Agent` to modify the source code based on the `edit_prompt` and MCP context.
    *   Render the modified Manim code to generate a new video chunk.
    *   Upload the new video chunk to AWS S3, replacing or versioning the old one.
    *   Upload the updated Manim source code to AWS S3.
    *   Update Convex.dev with the new S3 URLs and status for the re-rendered scene.
*   **S3 Utility Functions:** Define helper functions for uploading video files and source code files to specified S3 buckets and generating their public URLs.

### 1.3. AWS S3 Setup

**Goal:** Configure S3 buckets for efficient storage and delivery of video assets and source code.

#### Tasks to Perform:
*   **Create S3 Buckets:** Set up dedicated S3 buckets for:
    *   Video chunks (e.g., `ai-video-tutor-chunks`)
    *   Manim source code files (e.g., `ai-video-tutor-source-code`)
    *   Other assets (e.g., images, audio files)
*   **Configure Bucket Policies:** Set appropriate access policies to allow read/write operations from the FastAPI application and public read access for CloudFront.
*   **Set up CloudFront CDN:** Create a CloudFront distribution for the S3 bucket containing video chunks and assets to ensure fast and global content delivery.

## Phase 2: Define Frontend Components and Functions

**Goal:** Build the interactive video editing and preview frontend using Remotion.dev and Next.js, with real-time synchronization via Convex.dev.

### 2.1. Remotion.dev + Next.js Project Setup

#### Functions/Components to Define:
*   **Next.js Application Initialization:** Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and ESLint.
*   **Remotion.dev Integration:** Configure Remotion.dev within the Next.js application, including setting video format, frame rate, and resolution.
*   **Remotion Composition:** Create a main Remotion composition that can accept an array of video chunk URLs and scene metadata. This composition will orchestrate the playback of individual video chunks.
*   **Video Sequence Component:** Develop a Remotion component responsible for playing individual video chunks based on the current frame and scene metadata. It should handle displaying the correct video chunk at the appropriate time.

### 2.2. Convex.dev Frontend Integration

#### Functions/Components to Define:
*   **Convex Client Setup:** Initialize the Convex React client and configure it with the Convex backend URL.
*   **Convex Provider:** Wrap the Next.js application with the Convex provider to enable data access throughout the application.
*   **Custom Hooks for Data Fetching:** Create custom React hooks (e.g., `useVideoSession`) to fetch `Project`, `VideoSession`, and `SceneMetadata` data from Convex.dev using real-time queries. These hooks should manage loading states and data updates.

### 2.3. Scene-based Video Player

#### Components to Define:
*   **Video Player Component:** A React component that:
    *   Embeds the Remotion player to display the video composition.
    *   Displays a progress bar with visual markers indicating scene boundaries.
    *   Allows users to click on scene markers to jump to specific scenes.
    *   Provides basic video controls (play/pause, seek).
*   **Scene List/Timeline Component:** A UI component that lists all scenes within a video session, showing their titles and durations. It should allow users to select a scene, which will then highlight the scene in the player and prepare it for editing.

## Phase 3: Define MCP Server Components and Functions

**Goal:** Implement a dedicated MCP server to provide direct, context-aware documentation to the AI agents, replacing the need for RAG.

### 3.1. MCP Server Core

#### Functions to Define:
*   **Server Initialization:** Set up a lightweight web server (e.g., using FastAPI or Flask) for the MCP.
*   **Documentation Loading Function:** Implement a function to load Manim documentation snippets and examples into memory or a fast-access data structure. For MVP, this could be from static JSON files or a simple database.
*   **Context Retrieval Endpoint:** Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/context/{topic}`) that, given a specific topic or keyword, returns relevant documentation snippets and code examples.
*   **Documentation Search Endpoint:** Create an API endpoint (e.g., `/search`) that allows AI agents to search the loaded documentation based on a query string, returning the most relevant snippets.

### 3.2. MCP Integration with AI Agents

#### Functions to Define (within FastAPI agents):
*   **MCP Context Fetcher:** A utility function within the `Code Generation Agent` (and potentially `Content Analysis Agent`) that makes HTTP requests to the MCP server to retrieve relevant documentation based on the current task or prompt.
*   **Prompt Augmentation:** Modify the AI agent's prompt construction logic to include the retrieved MCP context. This ensures that the AI model has direct access to the necessary Manim documentation when generating or editing code.

## Phase 4: Define Integration and Testing Procedures

**Goal:** Ensure all components work together seamlessly and the MVP meets its functional and performance requirements.

### 4.1. End-to-End Workflow Testing

#### Procedures to Define:
*   **Initial Video Generation Test:** A test case to verify that a new video can be successfully generated from a text prompt, broken into chunks, uploaded to S3, and its metadata stored in Convex.dev.
*   **Video Playback Test:** A test case to confirm that the Remotion.dev frontend can correctly fetch video chunks from S3 via Convex.dev and play them back seamlessly.
*   **Scene Selection Test:** A test case to verify that users can select individual scenes in the frontend, and the correct scene metadata is loaded for editing.
*   **Scene Editing Workflow Test:** A comprehensive test case that covers the entire editing loop:
    *   User submits an edit prompt for a scene.
    *   Convex.dev triggers the FastAPI webhook.
    *   FastAPI retrieves original code, calls AI to modify, re-renders video.
    *   New video chunk and source code are uploaded to S3.
    *   Convex.dev is updated, and the frontend reflects the changes in real-time.
*   **Error Handling Tests:** Test various error scenarios, such as failed video generation, S3 upload failures, or AI model errors, and verify that appropriate error messages are displayed to the user and logged in the backend.

### 4.2. Performance & Optimization

#### Procedures to Define:
*   **Performance Monitoring:** Implement logging and metrics collection for key operations, such as video generation time, scene re-rendering time, S3 upload/download speeds, and API response times.
*   **Basic Caching Strategy:** Define a strategy for caching frequently accessed data (e.g., Manim documentation in the MCP server, or scene code snippets in Redis) to reduce redundant computations and API calls.
*   **Asynchronous Processing Verification:** Ensure that long-running tasks (video generation, rendering) are truly asynchronous and do not block the user interface or API responsiveness.

### 4.3. User Experience Polish

#### Tasks to Perform:
*   **Loading States:** Implement clear loading indicators for processes like video generation, scene re-rendering, and data fetching.
*   **Error Messages:** Design user-friendly error messages that guide the user on how to resolve issues.
*   **Input Validation:** Implement frontend and backend validation for user inputs (e.g., prompts, project names).
*   **Responsive Design:** Ensure the frontend is usable and visually appealing across different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).

## Phase 5: Outline Deployment and Future Steps

**Goal:** Prepare the MVP for deployment and outline the next steps for future development.

### 5.1. Deployment Preparation

#### Tasks to Perform:
*   **Environment Configuration:** Define environment variables for API keys, S3 credentials, Convex URLs, and other service endpoints for development, staging, and production environments.
*   **Deployment Scripts/Instructions:** Create clear instructions or scripts for deploying each component:
    *   Convex.dev backend (via Convex CLI).
    *   FastAPI multi-agent system (e.g., to a cloud platform like AWS Fargate, Lambda, or a Kubernetes cluster).
    *   MCP server (can be deployed alongside FastAPI or as a separate service).
    *   Next.js/Remotion.dev frontend (e.g., to Vercel, Netlify, or AWS Amplify).
*   **Dependency Management:** Ensure all project dependencies are properly listed and managed (e.g., `package.json` for Node.js, `requirements.txt` for Python).

### 5.2. Future Steps and Iterations

#### Areas for Future Development:
*   **Advanced Editing Features:** Implement more sophisticated video editing capabilities, such as:
    *   Multi-scene batch editing.
    *   Timeline manipulation (reordering, trimming scenes).
    *   Adding overlays, music, and voiceovers.
    *   Version control for scene edits.
*   **Enhanced AI Agents:** Improve the intelligence and capabilities of AI agents, including:
    *   More nuanced content analysis.
    *   Better understanding of complex Manim concepts.
    *   Ability to generate more diverse animation styles.
*   **User Management & Collaboration:** Implement robust user roles, permissions, and collaboration features for team projects.
*   **Templates and Presets:** Allow users to save and reuse video templates or scene presets.
*   **Performance Scaling:** Further optimize performance for large-scale video generation and concurrent users, including advanced caching, load balancing, and distributed rendering.
*   **Analytics and Monitoring:** Integrate comprehensive analytics to track user engagement and system performance.
*   **Monetization:** Explore options for subscription models or pay-per-use features.
