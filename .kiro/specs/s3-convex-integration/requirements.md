# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The S3-Convex Integration feature enhances the AI Video Tutor platform by seamlessly connecting the existing S3 storage system with Convex.dev database. This integration ensures that all video assets, scene metadata, and file references are properly synchronized between cloud storage and the real-time database, enabling efficient content delivery, version management, and real-time updates across the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: S3 Asset URL Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want all my video assets to be accessible via reliable URLs stored in the database, so that I can quickly access and share my content without worrying about broken links.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a file is uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL store the corresponding S3 URL in Convex with proper metadata
2. WHEN S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL is configured THEN the system SHALL generate public CDN URLs for assets
3. WHEN S3_PUBLIC_BASE_URL is not configured THEN the system SHALL generate presigned URLs with configurable expiration times
4. WHEN assets are accessed THEN the system SHALL serve URLs from Convex database rather than generating them on-demand
5. WHEN URL generation fails THEN the system SHALL log errors and provide fallback mechanisms

### Requirement 2: Video Session and Scene Asset Tracking

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to automatically track all assets associated with my video sessions and scenes, so that I can manage versions and access files efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video session is created THEN the system SHALL create corresponding records in Convex with asset tracking fields
2. WHEN scene videos are rendered THEN the system SHALL update Convex with S3 URLs for video files, source code, and metadata
3. WHEN scene editing occurs THEN the system SHALL maintain version history of assets in Convex with timestamps
4. WHEN assets are uploaded to S3 THEN the system SHALL immediately sync metadata to Convex including file size, content type, and checksums
5. WHEN asset synchronization fails THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 3: Real-time Asset Status Updates

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to see real-time updates when my video assets are being processed or become available, so that I can monitor progress and know when content is ready.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN S3 uploads are in progress THEN Convex SHALL reflect upload status with progress indicators
2. WHEN assets become available in S3 THEN Convex subscriptions SHALL notify connected clients immediately
3. WHEN asset processing fails THEN the system SHALL update Convex with error states and retry information
4. WHEN multiple assets are being processed THEN the system SHALL provide batch status updates to avoid overwhelming the UI
5. WHEN network connectivity issues occur THEN the system SHALL queue status updates and sync when connection is restored

### Requirement 4: Asset Cleanup and Lifecycle Management

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want automated cleanup of unused assets and proper lifecycle management, so that storage costs remain controlled and the system stays performant.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video sessions are deleted THEN the system SHALL mark associated S3 assets for cleanup in Convex
2. WHEN asset cleanup is triggered THEN the system SHALL remove files from S3 and update Convex records accordingly
3. WHEN scene versions become obsolete THEN the system SHALL implement configurable retention policies for old assets
4. WHEN cleanup operations fail THEN the system SHALL log errors and schedule retry attempts
5. WHEN assets are accessed after cleanup THEN the system SHALL handle missing files gracefully with appropriate error messages

### Requirement 5: Batch Operations and Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want efficient handling of multiple asset operations, so that bulk uploads and downloads don't impact system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple files are uploaded simultaneously THEN the system SHALL use S3Storage.upload_dir with controlled concurrency
2. WHEN batch operations occur THEN Convex updates SHALL be batched to minimize database transactions
3. WHEN large manifests are generated THEN the system SHALL write manifest.json files to S3 and reference them in Convex
4. WHEN asset metadata is queried THEN the system SHALL implement efficient indexing and caching strategies in Convex
5. WHEN concurrent operations occur THEN the system SHALL prevent race conditions and maintain data consistency

### Requirement 6: Error Recovery and Data Integrity

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to maintain data consistency between S3 and Convex even when errors occur, so that my content remains accessible and reliable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN S3 uploads succeed but Convex updates fail THEN the system SHALL implement compensating transactions to maintain consistency
2. WHEN Convex updates succeed but S3 uploads fail THEN the system SHALL clean up database records and retry the operation
3. WHEN partial failures occur in batch operations THEN the system SHALL track which operations succeeded and retry only failed items
4. WHEN data inconsistencies are detected THEN the system SHALL provide reconciliation mechanisms to restore consistency
5. WHEN recovery operations are needed THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging and monitoring

### Requirement 7: Security and Access Control Integration

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want secure access to my assets with proper authentication and authorization, so that my content remains private and protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access assets THEN the system SHALL verify permissions through Convex before generating S3 URLs
2. WHEN presigned URLs are generated THEN they SHALL have appropriate expiration times based on user context and content sensitivity
3. WHEN KMS encryption is enabled THEN the system SHALL properly handle encrypted assets and maintain encryption metadata in Convex
4. WHEN cross-origin requests occur THEN the system SHALL implement proper CORS policies for S3 and Convex integration
5. WHEN audit trails are needed THEN the system SHALL log asset access patterns and permission checks in Convex

### Requirement 8: Configuration and Environment Management

**User Story:** As a developer, I want flexible configuration options for different environments, so that I can deploy the integration across development, staging, and production environments.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN S3_UPLOAD_ON_WRITE is enabled THEN the system SHALL immediately sync assets to Convex upon S3 upload completion
2. WHEN S3_UPLOAD_ON_WRITE is disabled THEN the system SHALL batch sync assets at the end of processing workflows
3. WHEN environment variables change THEN the system SHALL adapt URL generation and storage behavior accordingly
4. WHEN development environments use MinIO THEN the system SHALL work seamlessly with local S3-compatible storage
5. WHEN configuration errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback to safe defaults

### Requirement 9: Monitoring and Observability

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring of the S3-Convex integration, so that I can identify issues quickly and maintain system reliability.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN asset operations occur THEN the system SHALL log structured events with correlation IDs for tracing
2. WHEN performance metrics are needed THEN the system SHALL track upload times, sync latencies, and error rates
3. WHEN anomalies are detected THEN the system SHALL alert administrators about unusual patterns or failures
4. WHEN debugging is required THEN the system SHALL provide detailed logs linking S3 operations to Convex transactions
5. WHEN system health checks run THEN the system SHALL verify connectivity and consistency between S3 and Convex
