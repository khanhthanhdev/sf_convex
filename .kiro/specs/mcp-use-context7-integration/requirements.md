# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature enables the integration of mcp-use library with Context7 MCP server specifically for accessing Manim Community documentation. Instead of using traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approaches, this integration will allow AI agents to dynamically retrieve Manim Community documentation through Context7's MCP server and feed this information to agents for enhanced code generation and assistance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to install and configure mcp-use with Context7 integration, so that I can create AI agents that can access Manim Community documentation instead of using traditional RAG approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs the installation command THEN mcp-use SHALL be installed with LangChain integration for agent creation
2. WHEN the developer configures API keys THEN the system SHALL securely store LLM provider keys in environment variables
3. WHEN the developer creates a configuration file THEN the system SHALL include Context7 MCP server for Manim Community documentation access
4. IF the installation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and troubleshooting guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an MCPClient that connects to Context7 MCP server, so that I can access Manim Community documentation programmatically through agents.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer initializes MCPClient THEN it SHALL connect to the existing Context7 MCP server configuration
2. WHEN the client connects to Context7 THEN it SHALL have access to Manim Community documentation retrieval tools
3. WHEN the client queries for Manim documentation THEN it SHALL return relevant code snippets and documentation
4. IF the Context7 server connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error information and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create an MCPAgent that can use Context7 for Manim Community documentation lookup, so that I can build AI assistants that provide accurate Manim code examples and guidance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer creates an MCPAgent THEN it SHALL integrate with the Context7-enabled MCPClient
2. WHEN the agent receives a query about Manim functionality THEN it SHALL use Context7 tools to retrieve relevant Manim Community documentation
3. WHEN the agent retrieves documentation THEN it SHALL feed this information to the LLM for generating accurate responses
4. WHEN the agent provides code examples THEN they SHALL be based on current Manim Community documentation rather than potentially outdated training data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure security and performance settings for my MCP agents, so that I can ensure safe and efficient operation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer configures the agent THEN they SHALL be able to restrict dangerous tools like shell access
2. WHEN the agent runs THEN it SHALL respect timeout settings to prevent hanging operations
3. WHEN multiple servers are configured THEN the system SHALL limit concurrent connections for resource management
4. WHEN sensitive operations are performed THEN the system SHALL use sandboxed execution when configured

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to test and verify the mcp-use Context7 integration with Manim Community documentation, so that I can ensure the agent can accurately retrieve and use Manim documentation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the developer runs verification tests THEN the system SHALL confirm mcp-use and Context7 integration are properly installed
2. WHEN the developer tests Context7 integration THEN it SHALL successfully retrieve Manim Community documentation
3. WHEN the developer queries for specific Manim functionality THEN the agent SHALL return accurate, up-to-date documentation and code examples
4. IF any component fails verification THEN the system SHALL provide specific troubleshooting steps for the mcp-use Context7 setup
