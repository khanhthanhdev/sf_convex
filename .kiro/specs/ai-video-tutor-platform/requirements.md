# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Video Tutor Platform is a comprehensive full-stack application that enables users to generate educational videos from text prompts and edit individual scenes through natural language instructions. The platform combines AI-powered content generation, video rendering with Manim, real-time collaboration features, and an intuitive scene-based editing interface to create a seamless educational content creation experience.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Video Generation from Text Prompts

**User Story:** As an educator, I want to generate educational videos from text descriptions, so that I can quickly create visual learning content without manual video editing skills.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a content prompt with desired scene count THEN the system SHALL generate a complete video broken into individual scene chunks
2. WHEN video generation is triggered THEN the system SHALL provide real-time status updates showing progress through generating, rendering, and ready states
3. WHEN video generation completes THEN each scene SHALL be stored as an individual MP4 file in cloud storage with unique versioned URLs
4. WHEN video generation fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and allow retry functionality
5. IF the content prompt is educational in nature THEN the system SHALL generate appropriate Manim animations with mathematical visualizations, diagrams, and text overlays

### Requirement 2: Scene-Based Video Editing

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to edit individual scenes within a generated video using natural language prompts, so that I can refine specific parts without regenerating the entire video.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user selects a scene from the video timeline THEN the system SHALL display the scene editor with current scene metadata and source code access
2. WHEN a user submits an edit prompt for a scene THEN the system SHALL modify the Manim source code and re-render only that specific scene
3. WHEN scene editing is in progress THEN the system SHALL show loading states and prevent concurrent edits on the same scene
4. WHEN scene editing completes THEN the system SHALL update the video player with the new scene version while maintaining seamless playback
5. WHEN scene editing fails THEN the system SHALL preserve the original scene and display error details to the user

### Requirement 3: Real-Time Video Playback and Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want to preview generated videos with frame-accurate scene navigation, so that I can review content and identify specific scenes for editing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a video session is loaded THEN the system SHALL display a video player with all scene chunks stitched together for seamless playback
2. WHEN a user clicks on scene markers in the timeline THEN the player SHALL jump to the exact start frame of the selected scene
3. WHEN video playback occurs THEN the system SHALL highlight the currently playing scene in the timeline and scene list
4. WHEN scenes are being generated or edited THEN the player SHALL show loading states for affected scenes while allowing playback of ready scenes
5. WHEN video data updates in real-time THEN the player SHALL automatically refresh to show new scene versions without requiring page reload

### Requirement 4: Multi-Agent AI System Integration

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the platform to leverage specialized AI agents for different tasks, so that content generation is optimized and contextually accurate.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN content analysis is needed THEN the Content Analysis Agent SHALL break down prompts into structured scene descriptions with educational objectives
2. WHEN code generation is required THEN the Code Generation Agent SHALL create valid Manim Python code using MCP server documentation context
3. WHEN scene editing is requested THEN the system SHALL retrieve original source code and apply modifications using AI agents with proper context
4. WHEN AI agents encounter errors THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic with exponential backoff and fallback strategies
5. IF MCP server provides documentation context THEN AI agents SHALL incorporate relevant Manim examples and best practices into generated code

### Requirement 5: Cloud Storage and Content Delivery

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want fast and reliable access to video content globally, so that I can share and view educational videos without performance issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video chunks are generated THEN the system SHALL upload them to AWS S3 with versioned keys and appropriate metadata
2. WHEN users access video content THEN the system SHALL serve videos through CloudFront CDN for optimal global performance
3. WHEN scene versions are updated THEN the system SHALL maintain version history and provide rollback capabilities
4. WHEN source code is generated THEN the system SHALL store Manim Python files in separate S3 buckets with proper access controls
5. WHEN video files are accessed THEN the system SHALL support HTTP range requests for efficient streaming and seeking

### Requirement 6: User Authentication and Project Management

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to securely manage my video projects and collaborate with others, so that I can organize my educational content effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user registers THEN the system SHALL authenticate via NextAuth with GitHub/Google OAuth providers
2. WHEN authenticated users create projects THEN the system SHALL associate projects with user accounts and enforce ownership permissions
3. WHEN users access projects THEN the system SHALL only display projects they own or have been granted access to
4. WHEN project data is modified THEN the system SHALL track changes with timestamps and user attribution
5. WHEN users manage multiple projects THEN the system SHALL provide a dashboard with project status, creation dates, and quick access links

### Requirement 7: Real-Time Data Synchronization

**User Story:** As a collaborative user, I want to see live updates when video generation or editing occurs, so that I can monitor progress and coordinate with team members.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation status changes THEN all connected clients SHALL receive real-time updates via Convex subscriptions
2. WHEN scene metadata is updated THEN the frontend SHALL automatically refresh affected UI components without user intervention
3. WHEN multiple users access the same project THEN the system SHALL show concurrent user activity and prevent conflicting edits
4. WHEN network connectivity is lost THEN the system SHALL queue updates and synchronize when connection is restored
5. WHEN real-time updates occur THEN the system SHALL maintain UI responsiveness and avoid jarring content shifts

### Requirement 8: Error Handling and System Reliability

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want the system to handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback, so that I can understand issues and take appropriate action.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN video generation fails THEN the system SHALL capture detailed error logs with correlation IDs for debugging
2. WHEN scene rendering encounters errors THEN the system SHALL implement automatic retry with exponential backoff up to 3 attempts
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the system SHALL provide user-friendly error messages while logging technical details for administrators
4. WHEN system resources are constrained THEN the system SHALL queue requests and provide estimated completion times
5. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL maintain data integrity and allow users to recover their work

### Requirement 9: Performance and Scalability
