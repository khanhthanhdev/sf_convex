- Files: kebab-case
- Import Style: relative

## Structure Requirements

- Service-oriented architecture
- Clear API boundaries between services
- Independent scaling and deployment


## Best Practices
- Keep related files together
- Use consistent naming across the project
- Maintain clear import/export patterns
- Document architectural decisions

## Code Examples:

```

├── services/
├── pages/
└── utils/

```
